## Redux
Redux providing the state management (zustand also the most popular labirary for state management)
React and Redux is different library (Redux is not only used with react , its also used with other libraries. but its popularly used with react)
when developing large scale application, we mantaine more data we can use redux, 
Redux offers easy debugging

Here using two redux lib
i) Redux Toolkit
ii) React-Redux
 Architecture:
 i) If we click on the button it will dispatch the action and its call the reducer fuction which updates slice of a redux store.
 ii)Now i need to read the data from cart store -> with help of selector
 iii)For example on click of ADD button i want to update the cart like 3,4,5.....
 for that our header component of cart "subscribing to the store" using selector

## Redux Toolkit
    - Redux Toolkit (npm redux toolkit)
      -Install @reduxjs/toolkit  and react-redux
      -But our store - in utils create a app store with the help of configurestore and add slices to it
      and in app.js import provider from react-redux
      and in app.js import appstore from "./utils/appStore" (<Provider store={appStore}</Provider>)
      -connect our store our app
      -Slice (cartSlice) 
      -Dispatch (action)
      -Selector -(subscribing to the store using a sector) ex: const cartItems = useSelector((store) => store.cart.item);
      -vanilla (older) Redux => Dont mutate the state, reurning was madatory
      -Redux Toolkit - We have to mutate the state, no need to return anything
      -Redux uses immer library to do all the mutate the state
      -Redux devtools
